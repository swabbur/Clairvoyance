I've chosen to use a linear combination of two similarity measures to increase reliability. The chosen measures are pearson's r and kendall's tau (b). Kendall's tau is based on ranking, similar to spearman's rho. However, it has a special case for handling ties.

Next, I decided to build an undirected graph of users. Only connecting those that have a similarity larger than a predetermined threshold. This ensures that everyone is matched to someone who is at least a little like him or her.

At last, the blossom algorithm is performed on the graph to find a max-weight matching. This step maximizes the average similarity for all users while retaining the lower-threshold defined in the previous step.
