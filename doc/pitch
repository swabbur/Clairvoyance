combined pearson (r) and kendall (tau-b) to evaluate the similarity between users both linearly and based on rank.
Using kendall's tau (b) instead of spearman since kendall's should handle ties better. Which is especially important
since the scale is such that the ranking indeed contains many ties. Also, neither pearson or kendall requires normalized/standardized data. Which makes the process a little simpler.
After determining the similarity between users, the blossom algorithm is used to find the maximum matching within
an undirected graph. To make sure everyone is matched with an acceptable partner, a threshold is used such that
edges won't be added if their weight (similarity) is lower than a set threshold (0.6 by default). If an odd number of
users is entered. The matching will be made and afterwards, the remaining user will be added to a pair such that it
yields the largest possible average similarity of the three users.
